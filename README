=== Introduction === 

This distribution contains everything required to build a basic google transit 
feed for Halifax Metro Transit, Canada. Note that it is woefully incomplete
at the moment. 

Requirements: GNU Make, Perl, Python 2.5.

=== Usage ===

First, check out a copy of google transit feed's tools:

cd $HOME/git
git clone git@github.com:wlach/googletransitdatafeed-halifax-fork.git

Set PYTHONPATH to the python directory in the above checkout:

export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/git/googletransitdatafeed-halifax-fork/python

Then just type "make" to build the feed. The output at the end is "feed.zip".
For fun, you can view this feed using the snazzy transit feed view application:

$HOME/git/googletransitdatafeed-halifax-fork/python/schedule_viewer.py \
    --feed=hfxfeed.zip
